# MiniDatabase-Racket

This is a mini database, implemented in Racket functional language. It contains the four basic database operations: insert, remove, select, update. It allows creating your own database in-place, and do unlimited queries to it.

The source code is in the mini-database.rkt, and the tester.rkt contains relevant database tests, proving that all the operations execute successfully.
